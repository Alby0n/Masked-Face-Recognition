# Masked Face Regonition
![Alt Text](https://media.giphy.com/media/3o7abnQiguzMTaYlOM/giphy.gif)

We should be able to identify subjects from CCTV footages even
when there are only limited number of photographs available for the
suspected individuals. The system should work in near real time and
even when there are partial occlusion, different pose, and physical
changes like beard , eye-glasses and face masks .
